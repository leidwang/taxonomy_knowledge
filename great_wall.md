# The Great Wall of China

The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic structures in world history. It is a series of walls and fortifications built along the historical northern borders of China to protect against various nomadic groups and military incursions.

## History

Construction began as early as the 7th century BC, but most of the existing structure dates from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The wall was built, rebuilt, and maintained over various dynasties.

## Structure

The wall is not a single, unbroken structure but a network of walls and fortifications stretching more than 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles). Its construction materials ranged from tamped earth and wood in early segments to bricks and stone during the Ming era.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Great Wall was military defense, but it also functioned to control trade and immigration along the Silk Road.

## Legacy

While large sections have fallen into disrepair, some parts have been restored and are major tourist attractions. It remains a symbol of China’s historical strength and resilience.
